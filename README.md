# Synthetic Data for Mental Health: A Comparative Analysis of LLMs, BERT, and Copy-Based Augmentation

This repository includes the source code, augmentation templates, and experimental configurations for the paper **"Synthetic Data for Mental Health: A Comparative Analysis of LLMs, BERT, and Copy-Based Augmentation"**, approved to BRACIS 2025.

## 🧠 Overview

We investigate textual data augmentation strategies to improve depression screening from Brazilian-Portuguese Instagram posts. The following methods were evaluated:

- ✅ Simple duplication (Copy-based augmentation)
- ✅ Contextual word substitution using BERT-based models
- ✅ Synthetic text generation via Large Language Models (LLMs), with and without modulation using BDI-II (Beck’s Depression Inventory) psychometric data

Classification is performed using:

- 📘 Single-Instance Learning (SIL)
- 📗 Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)

All models are trained on multilingual sentence embeddings and evaluated using an XGBoost classifier with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 🥇 MIL consistently outperforms SIL across all data augmentation strategies, confirming that leveraging user-level information enhances performance.

- 🧠 Among LLMs, Dolphin 3 surpasses larger models, indicating that compact architectures can yield high-quality synthetic data with lower computational overhead.

- 📈 For both LLM-based and Contextual (BERT) augmentation, the best F1-scores are achieved with an augmentation factor of $n = 1$, suggesting that excessive synthetic data may introduce noise and degrade performance.

- ⚡ Contextual BERT substitution provides an effective balance between performance and efficiency.

- ⚠️ Incorporating BDI-II modulation into synthetic generation leads to stylistic inconsistencies and harms model accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset

The experiments use a real Instagram dataset with BDI-II clinical annotations, collected from university students in Brazil.

- 221 users
- Posts labeled as depressed or non-depressed
- BDI-II cutoffs: minimal/mild (non-depressed), moderate/severe (depressed)
- Only training data is augmented; validation and test sets remain unaltered
